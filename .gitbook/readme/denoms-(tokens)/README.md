# Denom

A denom is how assets are represented within the Bank module of Injective. These assets can be used for trading, creating new markets on the exchange module, participating in auctions, transferring to another address, etc.

Depending on the origin of the denom and how it was created on Injective we have different types of denoms:

* **Native denoms** - there is only one denom of this type, the `inj` denom which represented the native coin of Injective,
* **Peggy denoms** - these denoms represent assets bridged over from Ethereum to Injective using the Peggy bridge. They have the following format `peggy{ERC20_CONTRACT_ADDRESS}`
* **IBC denoms** - these denoms represent assets bridged over from other Cosmos chains through IBC. They have the following format `ibc/{hash}`.
* **Insurance Fund Denoms** - these denoms represent token shares of the insurance funds created on Injective. They have the following format `share{id}`
* **Factory Denoms** - these denoms are a representation of a CW20 token from Cosmwasm on the Injective native bank module. They have the following format `factory/{OWNER}/{SUBDENOM}` where the `OWNER` is the owner who created the  factory denom. One example is the CW20 token factory denom `factory/{CW20_ADAPTER_CONTRACT}/{CW20_CONTRACT_ADDRESS}` where the `CW20_ADAPTER_CONTRACT` is the adapter contract address which does the conversion between CW20 and the native Bank module.

### Token

Token is simply a denom on the Injective chain with some meta information. The metadata includes information like symbol, name, decimals, logo for the particular denom, etc. The metadata of the denom is quite important for a dApp developer as information on the chain is stored in its raw form (for example `1inj` on the chain is represented as `1*10^18inj`) so we need to have a way to show the user human-readable information (numbers, logo, symbol, etc). To convert a denom to a Token, weâ€™ve built an abstraction class within the `sdk-ts` which uses the `token-metadata` package to convert known denoms to a Token representation.


# Token Metadata

Assets on Injective are represented as denoms. Denoms (and the amounts) are not humanly readable and this is why we need to have a way to "attach" token metadata information for a particular denom. This is achievable using the `@injectivelabs/token-metadata` package.

Let's recap the types of denoms we have in the Getting Started section:

* **Native denoms** - there is only one denom of this type, the `inj` denom which represented the native coin of Injective,
* **Peggy denoms** - these denoms represent assets bridged over from Ethereum to Injective using the Peggy bridge. They have the following format `peggy{ERC20_CONTRACT_ADDRESS}`
* **IBC denoms** - these denoms represent assets bridged over from other Cosmos chains through IBC. They have the following format `ibc/{hash}`.
* **Insurance Fund Denoms** - these denoms represent token shares of the insurance funds created on Injective. The have the following format `share{id}`
* **Factory Denoms** - these denoms are a representation of a CW20 token from Cosmwasm on the Injective native bank module. They have the following format `factory/{CW20_ADAPTER_CONTRACT}/{CW20_CONTRACT_ADDRESS}` where the `CW20_ADAPTER_CONTRACT` is the adapter contract address which does the conversion between CW20 and the native Bank module.

Token is simply a denom on the Injective chain with some meta information. The metadata includes information like symbol, name, decimals, logo for the particular denom, etc. It has the following interface (more details can be found in [types.ts](https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/injective-ts/blob/master/packages/token-metadata/src/types.ts))

```ts
export interface Token {
  denom: string

  name: string
  logo: string
  symbol: string
  decimals: number
  tokenType?: TokenType
  coinGeckoId: string

  ibc?: IbcTokenMeta
  evm?: EvmTokenMeta
  spl?: SplTokenMeta
  cw20?: Cw20TokenMeta
  cw20s?: Cw20TokenMetaWithSource[] // When there are multiple variations of the same CW20 token
  erc20?: Erc20TokenMeta
}
```
