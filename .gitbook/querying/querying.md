# Querying

There are 2 data sources that can be accessed through the `sdk-ts`:

* The Injective chain itself through a sentry node,
* The Indexer API (indexer of events from the Injective chain to a MongoDB),

For each of the data sources there are two ways that they can be queried:

* using the gRPC protocol,
* Using HTTP REST

We also have a GraphQL consumer of the Peggy subgraph on Ethereum (used only for tracking deposits and withdrawals on Ethereum).

For the 2 main data sources, there are abstraction classes that developers can use to access specific modules of the Injective Chain **or** specific modules within the Exchange API. The responses of these requests are always mapped into normal JavaScript objects (regardless of the data source type) and served to the end user.
