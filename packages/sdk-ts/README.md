_Accessing decentralized finance through TypeScript (for Web and Node environment)_

`@injectivelabs/sdk-ts` is a TypeScript SDK for writing applications on top of the Injective chain in both a Node.js and a browser environment.

### âœ¨ Features

- **Written in TypeScript**, with type definitions,
- Works in Node.js and in the browser,
- Exposes on-chain data and the exchange-api data,
- Parses responses into native JavaScript types
- much more ...

We highly suggest using the `@injectivelabs/sdk-ts` with TypeScript, or JavaScript in a code editor that has support for type declarations, so you can take advantage of the helpful type hints that are included with the package.


### ðŸ“š Installation

```bash
yarn add @injectivelabs/sdk-ts
```

## ðŸ“– Documentation

There are two pieces of the `sdk-ts` - **querying a data source** and **making transactions**.

### Querying a data source

There are 2 data sources that can be accessed through the `sdk-ts`:

- The Injective chain itself through a sentry node,
- The Indexer API (indexer of events from the Injective chain to a MongoDB),

For each of the data sources there are two ways that they can be queried:

- using the gRPC protocol,
- using REST

We also have a GraphQL consumer of the Peggy subgraph on Ethereum (used only for tracking deposits and withdrawals on Ethereum).

For the 2 main data sources, there are abstraction classes that developers can use to access specific modules of the Injective Chain **or** specific modules within the Exchange API. The responses of these requests are always mapped into normal JavaScript objects (regardless of the data source type) and served to the end user.

### Making Transactions

To interact with Injective, the user has to issue a transaction. Each transaction that is broadcasted to Injective can hold multiple messages that can change the state of the Injective chain. Within the `core` folder, developers can find a convenient way to make these messages with methods that can convert these messages in a way that they can be used by developers in different scenarios (broadcasting using the normal cosmos way or converted to EIP712 to be signed using Ethereum wallets).

Every message extends the `MsgBase` interface, which has couple of mapping functionalities:
- `toData` -> Converts the Message to a simple Object representation,
- `toProto` -> Returns a proto representation of the Message,
- `toDirectSign` -> Converts the Message to a proto representation (ready to be used in the normal Cosmos way of handling transactions),
- `toAmino` -> Converts the Message to a amino representation + type (usually used to covert the message to EIP712 typed data to be signable in Ethereum native wallets),
- `toWeb3` -> same as toAmino (deprecated)

There are also some utility classes and functions that are exposed from the package. There is also a `local` folder that exposes some utility classes that can be used to make developers life easier in a Node environment.

## ðŸŽ’ Usage

Let's go through couple of use-cases of the `sdk-ts` so developers can have a reference codebase that they can look at.

### Consuming data

- Fetching user's inj balance from the chain

```ts
// Importing only the needed API
import { ChainGrpcBankApi, Network } from '@injectivelabs/sdk-ts'

const network = Network.testnet()
const injectiveAddress = 'inj1hkhdaj2a2clmq5jq6mspsggqs32vynpk228q3r'
const denom = 'inj'
const chainGrpcBankApi = new ChainGrpcBankApi(network.sentryGrpcApi)
console.log(await chainGrpcBankApi.fetchBalance({ injectiveAddress, denom }))
```

```ts
// Using the client
import { ChainGrpcClient, Network } from '@injectivelabs/sdk-ts'

const network = Network.testnet()
const injectiveAddress = 'inj1hkhdaj2a2clmq5jq6mspsggqs32vynpk228q3r'
const denom = 'inj'
const chainGrpcClient = new ChainGrpcClient(network.sentryGrpcApi)
console.log(await chainGrpcClient.bank.fetchBalance({ injectiveAddress, denom }))
```

- Fetching all derivative markets from the exchange (indexer) API

```ts
// Importing only the needed API
import { IndexerGrpcDerivativesApi, Network } from '@injectivelabs/sdk-ts'

const network = Network.testnet()
const exchangeGrpcDerivativesApi = new IndexerGrpcDerivativesApi(network.indexerApi)
console.log(await exchangeGrpcDerivativesApi.fetchMarkets())
```

```ts
// Using the client
import { IndexerGrpcClient, Network } from '@injectivelabs/sdk-ts'

const network = Network.testnet()
const exchangeGrpcClient = new IndexerGrpcClient(network.indexerApi)
console.log(await exchangeGrpcClient.derivatives.fetchMarkets())
```

### Broadcasting Transactions

- Sending INJ to another address

```ts
import { getNetworkInfo, Network } from "@injectivelabs/networks";
import { ChainRestAuthApi } from "@injectivelabs/sdk-ts";
import { PrivateKey } from "@injectivelabs/sdk-ts/dist/local";
import {
  privateKeyToPublicKeyBase64,
  MsgSend,
  DEFAULT_STD_FEE,
} from "@injectivelabs/sdk-ts";
import { createTransaction } from "@injectivelabs/tx-ts";
import { TxGrpcClient, TxClient } from "@injectivelabs/tx-ts/dist/client";
import { BigNumberInBase } from "@injectivelabs/utils";

/** MsgSend Example */
(async () => {
  const network = getNetworkInfo(Network.Public);
  const privateKeyHash =
    "f9db9bf330e23cb7839039e944adef6e9df447b90b503d5b4464c90bea9022f3";
  const privateKey = PrivateKey.fromPrivateKey(privateKeyHash);
  const injectiveAddress = privateKey.toBech32();
  const publicKey = privateKeyToPublicKeyBase64(
    Buffer.from(privateKeyHash, "hex")
  );

  /** Account Details **/
  const accountDetails = await new ChainRestAuthApi(
    network.sentryHttpApi
  ).fetchAccount(injectiveAddress);

  /** Prepare the Message */
  const amount = {
    amount: new BigNumberInBase(0.01).toWei().toFixed(),
    denom: "inj",
  };

  const msg = MsgSend.fromJSON({
    amount,
    srcInjectiveAddress: injectiveAddress,
    dstInjectiveAddress: injectiveAddress,
  });

  /** Prepare the Transaction **/
  const { signBytes, txRaw } = createTransaction({
    message: msg.toDirectSign(),
    memo: "",
    fee: DEFAULT_STD_FEE,
    pubKey: Buffer.from(publicKey).toString("base64"),
    sequence: parseInt(accountDetails.account.base_account.sequence, 10),
    accountNumber: parseInt(
      accountDetails.account.base_account.account_number,
      10
    ),
    chainId: network.chainId,
  });

  /** Sign transaction */
  const signature = await privateKey.sign(signBytes);

  /** Append Signatures */
  txRaw.setSignaturesList([signature]);

  /** Calculate hash of the transaction */
  console.log(`Transaction Hash: ${await TxClient.hash(txRaw)}`);

  const txService = new TxGrpcClient({
    txRaw,
    endpoint: network.sentryGrpcApi,
  });

  /** Simulate transaction */
  const simulationResponse = await txService.simulate();
  console.log(
    `Transaction simulation response: ${JSON.stringify(
      simulationResponse.gasInfo
    )}`
  );

  /** Broadcast transaction */
  const txResponse = await txService.broadcast();
  console.log(
    `Broadcasted transaction hash: ${JSON.stringify(txResponse.txhash)}`
  );
})();
```

### Streaming Data

- Streaming users subaccount balances from the indexer API

```ts
import { getNetworkInfo, Network } from "@injectivelabs/networks";
import { IndexerGrpcStreamClient } from "@injectivelabs/sdk-ts/dist/client/indexer/IndexerGrpcStreamClient";

(async () => {
  const network = getNetworkInfo(Network.TestnetK8s);

  const subaccountId =
    "0xaf79152ac5df276d9a8e1e2e22822f9713474902000000000000000000000000";

  const exchangeClient = new IndexerGrpcStreamClient(
    network.indexerApi
  );

  await exchangeClient.account.streamSubaccountBalance({
    subaccountId,
    callback: (subaccountBalance) => {
      console.log(subaccountBalance);
    },
    onEndCallback: (status) => {
      console.log("Stream has ended with status: " + status);
    },
  });
})();
```
