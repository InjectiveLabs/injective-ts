_A convenient way to consume Referral API_

---

## 📚 Installation

```bash
yarn add @injectivelabs/referral-consumer
```

## 📖 Documentation

This package is a TypeScript wrapper around the GRPC API provided by our Injective Exchange for the referral API.

The package is split between two separate concerns, "consumers" and "transformers". With the "consumers" we are making GRPC API calls to the Injective Exchange, and with the "transformers" we are transforming the data from a protobuf message to a plain TypeScript object that can be used more conveniently.

## 📖 Example Usage

```ts

```
